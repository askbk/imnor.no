                        <strong>Students in the age of 14-19 years (high school) </strong><br>
                        This is InMarket's main target audience. This is the group that experiences major changes, little involvement and a lot of governance. Our goal is to connect them to something stable and established. We want to provide them with knowledge of career opportunities, knowledge of where and how the knowledge can be applied, expectations from society and the opportunity they themselves have to influence their own future.

            <p>InMarket will on the basis of the increasing pressure on the worker and demands for performance and qualifications, make an effort to increase safety and confidence in the workplace. We are convinced that the knowledge and confidence around a place where one spends 35-40% (if not more) of their time will increase the average standard of living. </p>
            <h3 class="golden-text">Innovation that increases well-being</h3>
            <p>InMarket wants to evolve in line with the major problems that need to be addressed locally, nationally and globally. The work done by us creates expectations from youth, students, employers and other networks. These expectations will therefore be in our best interest to meet.</p>
            <p>The greatest factor in succeeding with our work is our ability to increase the well-being of those we connect with. Enjoyment provides peace of mind, and safety allows you to trade with certainty. We therefore rely heavily on creating a safe environment.</p>
