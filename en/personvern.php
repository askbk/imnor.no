        <h2 class=" w3-center">Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Statement describes how InMarket AS, here referred to as InMarket, collects and uses personal information.</p>
        <p>InMarket, at the director, is responsible for the treatment of the company's processing of personal data. Where the day-to-day responsibility is delegated, it will be specified at the relevant section. The delegation covers only the tasks and not the responsibility. The declaration contains information you are entitled to when we are collecting information from our website (section 19 of the Personal Data Act) and general information on how we process personal data (section 18, first paragraph, of the Personal Data Act).</p>
        <h3 class=" w3-center">Processing of personal information at www.inmarket.as</h3>
        <p>The IT manager has the daily responsibility for InMarket's processing of personal information on Inmarket.as. It is voluntary for those who visit the websites to provide personal information in connection with services, such as registering users in a database. The treatment basis is the consent of the individual, unless otherwise specified.</p>
        <p>Domeneshop is InMarket's data processor, and is our web hosting provider.</p>
        <p>Information collected in connection with the operation of a website is stored on its own servers which are operated by the supplier. Only the InMarket and the Domain Shop have access to the information that is collected. A separate data processing agreement between InMarket and Domeneshop regulates what information the supplier has access to and how it should be processed.</p>
        <h3 class=" w3-center">Web page statistics</h3>
        <p>InMarket collects anonymous information about visitors to inmarket.as. The purpose of this is to compile statistics that we use to improve and further develop the information on the website. Examples of what the statistics answer to are how many people visit different pages, how long the visit lasts, which sites the users come from and which browsers are used.</p>
        <p>The information is processed in a de-identified and aggregated form. By de-identified it is meant that we cannot trace the information we collect back to the individual user. We collect the entire IP address, but the IP address is de-identified so that only the first three groups in the address are used to generate statistics. That is, if the IP address consists of the numbers 195.159.103.82, only 195.159.103.xx is used. In addition, the IP addresses are processed at the aggregate level, meaning all data is merged into one group and not processed individually.</p>
        <p>We use the Hotjar analysis tool on our site. This is a proprietary closed-source tool. Information from this tool is stored at Amazon Web Services in Ireland, and InMarket is the only player with access to this data.</p>
        <h3 class=" w3-center">Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer when you download a website. The storage of information and the processing of this information is not permitted unless the user has been informed and has given his consent to the processing. The user shall know about and approve which information is processed, what the purpose of the processing is and who is processing the information, cf. Electronic Communications Act ยง 2-7b.</p>
        <p>The following cookies are used on inmarket.as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Hotjar Analysis Tool places one cookie ("_hjIncludedInSample") for use to track visits. This cookie is deleted when you exit the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class=" w3-center">Contact form on website</h3>
        <p>On the website you can ask InMarket to contact regarding further guidance or wishes about company visits etc..

        <p>The Staff Director has the daily responsibility for InMarket's surveys. We will always inform about the purpose of the survey and whether it is anonymous or not. InMarket will not share the information with others or use the information for any purpose other than that specified.</p>
